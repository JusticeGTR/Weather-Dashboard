# Weather-Dashboard

This is our sixth homework assignment in nu-chi-fsf-ft-03-2021-u-c! 

In this excercise, we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard that can take a user inputted city, save it to local storage as well as a list of searched cities, and pull up various current and future weather conditions.

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

This one bent my mind a bit. The api stuff and local storage is still a bit tough. Hopefully I'll feel stronger on it soon.
